# Credits

The game was made by me, as well as many features and characteristics that were created and implemented in **Odyssey Of Shadows**. Nontheless this project would not have been possible without the teaching and guidance of [Stephen Ulibarri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-ulibarri-980a10169/). I would also like to thank [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/https://www.gamedev.tv/) for their courses and guidance during the past years with many of my projects.

 # Notes

 - **This is my first Unreal Engine project.**
 - The character doesn't have hair given that the plugin that handles it causes errors which prevents a proper export.
